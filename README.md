For the CRUD assignment, I built a twitter clone, but called it Twittter with 3 T's to signify it is a clone. I used a lot of different tutorials online to actually help me accomplish this. Unfortunetly, when I got to the end of the tutorial, I tried to run it on my local server, but for some reason it wasn't showing up. Realistically though, even though it doesn't exactly work the way that I want it to, I learned a ton, and am honestly really excited about it. So much so that I bragged to one of my friends who now wants me to teach him what I know. It's crazy to think that at the beginning of this class I was extremely overwhelmed by all of the lingo, and now I built a Twitter clone.

Overall, some of the coolest features I added were user funtionality using a ruby gem called Devise. I also used other gems such as Burma to work with UI. I also added posting, liking, and commenting. Definitely one of the most complicated things I've ever built, but well worth it.
